The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced the development and functionality of robotoids-robotic systems designed to handle complex task, this study explores the pivotal role played by artificial intelligence in enhancing robotoidsâ€™ learning and adaptability, a class of advanced robots designed to
mimic human-like behaviour and decision making process focusing on the integration of AI techniques such as machine learning, neural networks and reinforcement learning
within robotoid systems to facilitate autonomous learning and adaptive responses to
dynamic environments , the research examines key areas such as the ability of AI-driven
robotoids to adjust to dynamic environments, make ethically sound decision, and
operate autonomously, . A mixed-method approach was employed involving interviews, surveys and document analysis. The findings underscore the transformative potential
of AI in advancing Robotoids technology, paving the way for more autonomous, resilient
and intelligent robotic systems capable of performing complex tasks in diverse settings. The study also reveals that while AI is considered highly significant in improving
adaptability, there are going challenges related to ethical decision making, legal
accountability, and the adequacy of current AI-technology, the results analyse the need
for updated legal framework, stronger AI-ethics, and transparency mechanisms such as
decision-logging systems. This research provides insights into the current state of AI- driven robotoids technology, its potential for future applications, and the area requiring
further improvement.
